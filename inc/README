Folders here are named in the format of:
  {StartYear}-{Company}-{RoleCode}

The use of StartYear, in lieu of EndYear, is to better support current jobs.

If we were using EndYear, we'd probably use "Current" instead of a year. In
such, when moving on to the next job, we'd have to rename a folder, making for
more work.
