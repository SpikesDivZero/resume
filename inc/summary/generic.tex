An accomplished software engineer and architect with a passion for leadership,
security, systems, and mentoring. I seek out challenges as opportunities for
growth, handle ambiguous situations well, and can break down complex problems
into creative solutions with actionable tasks.

I am seeking a challenging senior technical or leadership role at a
forward-thinking company.
