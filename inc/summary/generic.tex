% FIXME: expertise vs "-leaning" (JR); for now, leaving it as is
A backend-leaning software engineer who excels at tackling complex problems across the entire stack.
I handle ambiguous and fluid situations well, break down hairy problems into creative solutions with actionable tasks,
and turn challenges into opportunities for growth.
% I'm passionate about building secure and scalable solutions and mentoring others.
