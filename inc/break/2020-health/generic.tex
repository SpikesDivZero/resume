% I should highlight what I've been doing to reenter work, and why I'm a decent investment.
\item Spent the last few months spinning back up; family health matters fully resolved
\item Current Go project is launch-control, a goroutine tracker and ordered shutdown manager
\item Learning/refreshing knowledge on: React, Go's runtime internals, websockets,
      Python, Rust, and a smattering of other things

% I don't feel like Rust is particularly strong, but I do want to call it out as a polyglot like thing.

% With regards to go runtime internals: sync.mutex => lock cmpxchg, global generic hash via AES-NI,
% abi0 vs abiinternal, generics implementation tradeoffs and preformance tradeoffs it implies, and 
% (as of drafting this update) looking into how the funcpc works (because I was annoyed by some limitations)
