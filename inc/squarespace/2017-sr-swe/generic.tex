% FIXME: 3000%, while entirely true, feels fake. I originally had 30x, but I guess that didn't communicate the size as
% well according to ORR review.

% Also, it may be worth considering tweaking this to read "from our February 2018 Super Bowl ad, fewer than 3 months"
% as, at the time of this comment, that causes the date to line up roughly under the start date of the job.
\item Successfully kept services online during a 3,000\% spike in traffic (really) from our Super Bowl ad, fewer than 3
  months into the job (February 2018); gathered requirements from all teams, built a specialized frontsite cache, and
  coordinated testing of functionality across all engineering teams (Python)

\item Architected and built a black box caching system for all customer websites; increased responsiveness from the CMS
  and reduced the number of requests to the application by 60\%, resulting in the reduction of hardware requirements to
  run the platform (Go, Python, Perl)

\item Built a Varnish module to offload security operations onto the cache layer (C)

\item Designed and built a system ensuring reliable broadcast of cache invalidation requests to all cache nodes; 98\% of
  invalidation requests were processed by all cache nodes within 1.2 seconds (Go, Java)

\item Built a robust Database User and Role Management; tooling had a full load, plan, request approval, then apply
  lifecycle; generated change plans were shipped to a central source for compliance and auditing (Python)

\item Managed the sunsetting of early TLS support, including communication with stakeholders (Java)
