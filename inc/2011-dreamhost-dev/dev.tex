\item GENERAL:
\item Configuration management using both Chef and in-house systems.
\item Projects included the launch of mod\_pagespeed (beat competitors to market) and the transition from subversion to git (including documentation and internal support).
\item Major contributions to the foundations/core of an old codebase (1997), without breaking production.
% FIXME: ^ Maybe move that bit to SrDev?
\item Notable contributions to the billing systems, thereby improving its resilience and extensibility.
\item Created detailed documented how the fraud detection systems worked.
\item Researched and documented many obscure settings and flags of the systems.
\item Fixed multiple security issues in the codebase.
\item Introduced CI processes from end-to-end, including: initial research/prototyping, getting buy-in, \\ implementation, training, and supporting the new system.
% ^ Forced line wrap to avoid "im-{\n}plementation", which looked weird to me.
