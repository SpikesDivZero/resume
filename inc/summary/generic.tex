% TODO: Re-introduce a scope for "an accomplished [...] engineer". I'm not a fan of how the JS/frontend community
% coopted "full-stack" to mean "full-stack but mostly front end only", and "generalist" feels really weak.
An accomplished software engineer and architect. I have a passion for leadership, security, and mentoring. I seek out
challenges as opportunities for growth, handle ambiguous and fluid situations well, and can break down complex problems
into creative solutions with actionable tasks.
