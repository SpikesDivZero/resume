At the time, DreamHost only hired graduates from Harvey Mudd College for roles on the development teams. I joined the
Support team with the goal of eventually joining the dev teams, with the full support the VP of Support (I was open and
honest about this goal in the interview process). Within 6 months, I was writing utilities for the support teams. A few
months later, I was working 50\% of the time with the dev team.
