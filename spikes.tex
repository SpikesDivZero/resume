%	SUMMARY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Summary}
(This section is still being written.) I am an experienced software engineer and architect with a passion for leadership, mentoring, systems, and security. I seek out challenges as opportunities for growth, handle ambiguous situations well, and can break down complex problems into actionable tasks.

I'm seeking a challenging senior technical or leadership role at ...

% FIXME: The Summary section still needs to be written.
%     Maybe include something about successfully juggling multiple things going on at the same time?
%     CM writes "Sometimes people also use this as an objective section, so if you have any specific types of roles that'd pique your interest more than others it can be a helpful mini-cover letter."
%     JLC writes "This is ambiguous. Your summary should be a one to two sentence section that:
%
%         1. Introduces you and your strengths.
%         2. Clearly states your objective.
%
%         "I am an experienced software engineer and architect with a passion for leadership, mentoring, and security. I am seeking a challenging senior technical role at a forward-thinking company."
%
%         Something like that. But, you know. Better."

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

% NB: Verb tense in this section is mostly present tense, since it's current events,
% with the exception of the personal lab, since it's completed and working.

\begin{rSubsection}{Sabbatical}{Sep 2016 - Present}{}{}
\item Successfully achieved many of the goals personally set at DreamHost; took a six-month sabbatical.
\item Learning C\# and Unity to mentor someone new to development.
%\item Reverse engineering games for fun. After beating a game, it's a fun challenge to reverse it and find little ways to tweak them.
%   Example projects: Cookie Clicker (simple/boring) and AdCap.
%   AdCap had a non-standard LZF compression routine (slightly non-standard/buggy, as other lzf libs wouldn't decompress it), as well as writing a custom MITM server to "validate" support codes to give free resources.
%    Not a game, but I also recently RE'd Charles Proxy (which I already lawfully purchased -- I'm only in it for the challenge) and wrote a keygen for it, because why not. The keygen source was immediately put into an encrypted archive volume after it was confirmed working, not to be distributed, because ethics.
\item Set up a personal lab within home office including four physical servers.
%   Configured the lab's gateway server as a router w/ DHCP on the lab network
%   Configured TFTP and DHCP server for bootstrapping bare metal machines
\item Reverse engineering software and embedded firmware.
%   Goal is wanting to better understand RE'ing embedded systems
%   Example projects: Sonos Play:1 (current) and Berg Little Printer (past)
%   Sonos Play:1 firmware is hampered by not having a license for a good RE tool like IDA -- Hopper, Binary Ninja, and similar affordable tools don't do a good job of processing binaries for this arch (PowerPC Gen2 a la PowerQUICC II Pro). :\
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{DreamHost}{Oct 2014 - Aug 2016}{Senior/Lead Software Engineer}{Los Angeles, CA}
\item Managed two direct reports.
%  One was a Jr Dev, who I'd worked with to get them to leveled up to Dev.
%  The other Jr was on track to level up when I left, and within a few months of my departure, has successfully gone to Dev. (This one probably needs some massaging, since it feels a bit wrong)
%  Beyond simply mentoring in place, encouraging them to reach out to other teams directly and be confidence enough in that regard.
\item Coordinated with other teams including Systems Engineering, Security, Support, and Corporate IT.
\item Managed core development infrastructure, including Gerrit and Jenkins.
\item Entrusted with various sets of secure credentials. Primary maintainer of deployed credentials.
\item Post-exploit incident response.
% ^ Clee writes "% likewise, "Post-exploit incident response." needs a little more flavor and probably
% a verb.did you manage the response? did you aid in response? did you notify of the need for
% response?" I agree with his assessment, but 'aided in' doesn't really carry as much impact on
% a resume, so I may leave it ambiguous for now, preferring to discuss it in the interview (same
% as I did with the personal lab).
\item Modernized deployment of the primary codebase and its dependencies (fully documented), cutting deployment time down from 20 minutes to around 45 seconds.
\item Technical and architectural lead on the DreamPress 2, VPS-SSD, and Malware Remover projects.
\item Very active in internal bug bounty program; reported several notable issues.
%    More than 11 significant security vulnerabilities reported before we Stopped counting, lol.

\begin{rSubsection}{DreamHost}{Jan 2011 - Oct 2014}{Software Engineer}{Los Angeles, CA}
\item Configuration management using both Chef and in-house systems.
\item Projects included the launch of mod\_pagespeed (beat competitors to market) and the transition from subversion to git (including documentation and internal support).
% Other projects that I can remember from this period:
%   Dedi Relaunch
%   ETL and report building for billing systems (chart.io)
%   Replicon integration (maybe. that was a nightmare project)
%   mod_pagespeed launch
%     Google launched it with GoDaddy announced as a launch partner. While Google was still "working with GoDaddy" to roll it out it, our team managed to test it and launch it, beating GoDaddy to market.
%     https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/2010/11/04/mod_pagespeed-now-available/
%   Svn->Git transition (from end-to-end -- docs, support, migration itself, etc)
%   LogicBoxes (maybe. that was a nightmare project)
\item Major contributions to the foundations/core of an old codebase (1997), without breaking production.
%    Proud of this, given the age and the fact that DH doesn't have good testing overall.
%   Object->_classdef (deprecating and safely removing v0 and v1 classdefs, with no errors, issues, or breakage)
%   Object->AUTOLOAD (deprecating and safely removing runtime accessor generation from a large amount of the codebase; project was still in progress at the time I left)
%   Nza->AjaxStep (making Ajax support a first-class citizen of the in-house web framework, without breaking existing code -- essentially converting a hacked-in only-sometimes-working bug -- no joke, a bug -- to an actual feature.
%   Nza -- steps can now 'use strict', which wasn't possible before. Code without 'use strict' in Perl land is a pretty massive issue, leading to many a . In the process of migrating existing steps to this new system, we discovered quite a few potential security issues that we were able to fix before they were ever discovered.
%   Controllers / central launcher / servicectl
%   Services -- migrated executable commands to an actual naming prefix to ensure that code isn't inadvertently and inappropriately executed, while still not breaking old code (sc_renamed)
\item Notable contributions to the billing systems, thereby improving its resilience and extensibility.
\item Created detailed documented how the fraud detection systems worked.
%   That billing disaster that took a couple weeks to clean up (INVNUM, or Merchant Invoice Number, being documented as Optional in the PFPro docs, but the library we were using was using it in a rather terribad way.)
\item Researched and documented many obscure settings and flags of the systems.
\item Fixed multiple security issues in the codebase.
%\item Audits -- for financial, security, admin, business, whatever
\item Introduced CI processes from end-to-end, including: initial research/prototyping, getting buy-in, \\ implementation, training, and supporting the new system.
% ^ Forced line wrap to avoid "im-{\n}plementation", which looked weird to me.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{DreamHost}{Nov 2009 - Jan 2011}{Technical Support}{Los Angeles, CA}
\item Specialized in resolving complex, ongoing problems where it was difficult to find the root cause.
% For example, when a customer's databases all disappeared on a routine mysqld restart, successfully locating, restoring, and sending a summary on what went wrong.
\item Diagnosed abnormally high load systems and troubleshot customer websites.
\item Configured systems - Linux-VServer, DNS, Apache, Nginx, users, and PHP.
\item Maintained a 99\% customer satisfaction rate.

\begin{rSubsection}{Page Provider}{Dec 2007 - Nov 2009}{Systems Admin}{Rancho Cucamonga, CA}
\item Startup hosting provider.
\item Built and deployed custom kernels and software for colocated customers.
\item Provisioned and deployed servers and services.
\item Configured and managed Apache, users, and databases.
